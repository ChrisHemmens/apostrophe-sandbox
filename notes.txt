Some notes on things I worked on offline.

Tell the team about more new jQuery plugins.

Tell the team that apos-no-height went away in favor of passing the noHeight option for slideshows.

You can now also pass a delay option for slideshows.

You can now define a jsonOptions array for any itemType. Any options passed to the item that are present in this array wind up in data attributes of the widget, where widget players can easily find them without hacks like a class on a wrapper div in the template. Be aware the name will get CSS-ified (dashes).
